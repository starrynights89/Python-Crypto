Substitution Cipher Solver
=========================

Simple substitution cipher solver. It not uses letter statistics as most do, instead it uses
intellectual algo based on wordlist.

## Usage ##

1. Copy encrypted text into encrypted.txt
2. In decrypt.py set MAX_GOODNESS_LEVEL with number 1 - 7, how many word dicts to use(see words/ for wordlists)  
3. In decrypt.py set MAX_BAD_WORDS_RATE with number 0.0 - 1.0, the max rate of bad words
4. Launch ./decrypt.py
